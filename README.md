This SQL project analyzes retail transaction data to uncover business insights. Using a relational database of sales records, product details, and store locations, key queries were written to:

- Identify top accounts.
- Analyze web sales sources.
- Look at running totals by month.
- Look for trends in seasonality with moving averages.
The project showcases my proficiency in writing complex SQL queries, using JOINs, subqueries, window functions, and aggregate operations to gain insights from raw retail data.
